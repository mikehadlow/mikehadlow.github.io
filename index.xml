That&amp;rsquo;s partly laziness on my part, and partly because Twitter provides a much more convenient platform for the quick take, but it&amp;rsquo;s also because there&amp;rsquo;s too much friction in publishing a post on my long running &lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/about/">Google Blogger&lt;/a> site &lt;a href="https://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/">Code Rant&lt;/a>. Google has done little to update the ancient Blogspot platform over the years and it&amp;rsquo;s showing its age. The effort required to upload and format a blog post is too high, and has effectively disincentivised me from blogging. In the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve sometimes managed just a single post per year. So, long overdue, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start a new blog here at &lt;strong>mikehadlow.com&lt;/strong> using modern developer platform technologies. This is the first post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://mikehadlow.com/top/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mikehadlow.com/top/about/</guid><description>Hello!
