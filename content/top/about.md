Hello! I am Mike Hadlow. I am a software engineer, based in the UK. I've been building software professionally for over 20 years. The majority of my career was with Microsoft development tools and technologies and since 2002 primarily with .NET. But for the last 3 years I've been working mostly with Node and TypeScript (and a little bit of Elm). During that time I've worked on a large range of projects in many different industries, ranging from finance and insurance to the music business. I've specialized in large scale software development and focussed particularly on distributed event driven architectures. I've worked on diverse platforms including on-premise, Kubernetes, and AWS serverless. My role has varied from software developer to chief software architect along with a small number of non-coding consultancy engagements.

__I'm always very interested in hearing about new opportunities, so please [contact]({{< ref "contact" >}}) me to talk about my availability.__

I'm an active open source developer. I'm the original author of [EasyNetQ](https://easynetq.com), the most popular .NET client for the RabbitMQ message server, although I'm no longer active on the project. In my spare time I currently develop and maintain [Guitar Dashboard](https://guitardashboard.com), a music theory explorer for guitarists.

I have particular experience and interest with the following:

* Modern development practice: continuous integration and delivery, Test-driven, GitOps, DevOps.
* Modern JS/TS software development with Node and Bun.
* The Microsoft .NET software development stack including C# since version 1.0.
* Cloud architecture, with a specific interest in Kubernetes.
* Web / HTTP implementation, particularly highly scalable web services.
* Large scale architectures, including microservices / SOA and messaging.
* Application architecture. I'm particularly interested in issues around composition.
* Functional programming including experience with F# and Elm and bringing functional techniques to C# and TS.
* Relational database design and implementation. Particularly PostgreSql and SQL Server.
* I relish implementation challenges such as complex 3rd party systems integrations, authentication systems, parsers etc.

Recent clients have included the following:

* __Vendr__ Vendr is a US startup dedicated to fixing B2B SaaS sales. I was involved in the rapid development of a wide range of features for this fast moving startup, but particularly around onboarding, authentication flows, and 3rd party integrations.
* __7 Digital__ 7digital is Europe's leading B2B digital media platform provider. I helped 7digital build large parts of the Juke.com platform back-end, including authentication, payment systems and partner integrations (such as the SONOS music player). Juke is a streaming music platform built for Media Saturn to serve the German market.
* __15below__ 15below is the world's leading airline integration services company. I was their chief software architect and helped build their development team. I introduced a successful message based architecture and helped them move to modern software development practices.
* __The Pensions Regulator__ TPR is the UK agency for pensions regulation. I was their chief software architect. I also lead the team which implemented their bespoke case management solution.
* __The Civil Aviation Authority__ The CAA is the UK's aviation regulator. I helped architect and implement the UK's aircraft registry.
* __ACE Insurance__ ACE Insurance (now Chubb Limited) is the worldâ€™s largest publicly traded property and casualty insurer. I architected and implemented a number of systems integration projects and mentored the team on service oriented architecture and web service implementation.
* __Virgin Media__ Virgin Media are the UK's leading cable TV and telephone provider. I helped implement the digital TV provisioning system.
