title: "Abstractions vs Humans"

My premise: That with each new layer (or level) of abstraction (what do I mean by this?) a programming language provides means you will lose a percentage of people who can use it (an arbitrary guess is 80% for example).

Simple model of an 'abstraction' is where a concrete value is replaced by a variable. The age 11 move from arithmetic to algebra.

so variables `var x = 10;`

generics `List<T>`

type classes `M<T>` (need to re-read Haskell sources to make sure I get this right)

Possibly also include recursion?

I think Dom misunderstands his core audience for F#, and that he should introduce type classes.

Very good model of skill floor and ceiling skill levels.
