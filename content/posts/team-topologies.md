Chapter 1: The problem with org charts. Describes the issues with traditional ways  of thinking about organizations. Introduces the themes of the book. 

Chapter 2: Conway's Law and why it matters. Organization structure constrains the set of possible software designs. Gives examples of a tech-layer based organization (DB, back-end, front-end, ops - very much like 15below and 24-7) and the software design that emerges, vs a stream aligned team (like Pinnacle). Also talks about communication channels and how more communication is not necessarily a good thing and how communication tool choice has an impact. 

Chapter 3: Team First Thinking. Teams should be the unit of organization, assignment, and reward, not individuals. Discussion of "Dunbar's number" - anthropological study of human group dynamics suggests an optimal team size of 5. Higher level groupings go in rough multiples of 3: 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, etc (side note that military organization usually follows these numbers). Beware of team cognitive load. A single team should only be required to maintain one complex subsystem.

Software should be sized for the team. Steps should be taken to minimize extraneous cognitive load, such as reducing emails, meetings, and intra-team communication. Investment should be made into a software platform that reduces the load on delivery teams. Management should set goals - the what and why of what needs to be done, rather than the how.

Much discussion about office layouts. Not particularly relevant for our new remote age.
