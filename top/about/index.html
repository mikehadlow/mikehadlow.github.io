I am Mike Hadlow. I am a software developer, based in the UK. I&rsquo;ve been building software professionally for over 20 years using Microsoft development tools and technologies and since 2002 primarily with .NET. Since 1998 I have worked as an independent contractor with my own consulting company, Suteki Ltd. During that time I&rsquo;ve worked on a large range of projects in many different industries, ranging from finance and insurance to the music business. I&rsquo;ve specialized in large scale software development and focussed particularly on distributed event driven architectures. More recently I&rsquo;ve been focussed on cloud architectures, including Kubernetes. My role has varied from software developer to chief software architect along with a small number of non-coding consultancy engagements.</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;m always very interested in hearing about new opportunities, so please <a href=https://mikehadlow.com/top/contact/>contact</a> me to talk about my availability.</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m an active open source developer. I&rsquo;m the original author of <a href=https://easynetq.com>EasyNetQ</a>, the most popular .NET client for the RabbitMQ message server, although I&rsquo;m no longer active on the project.
